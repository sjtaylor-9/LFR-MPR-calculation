# Production of LFR-AS-200 and LFR-AS-30 MPRs to be used in newcleo ORION simulations
This repository contains the necessary scripts to generate the MPR files needed to run ORION simulations of newcleo's LFR-AS-200 and LFR-AS-30 nuclear fuel cycles. The MPR's generated are based on 2024 neutron spectra, which for the LFR-AS-200 is 3 enrichment zones (inner, middle, outer) and 2 burnup steps corresponding to the Beginning of Cycle, BoC, and the End of Cycle, EoC. For the LFR-AS-30 the scripts used a single enrichment zone (denoted as Fuel Assembly, FA) and a single burnup step (denoted as single).

## How to use
In order to run these scripts a conda environment with the following packages is required:
```numpy```,
```pandas```,
